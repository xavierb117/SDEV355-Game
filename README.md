# SDEV355-Game: Finance Clicking Game
- The main goal of the game is to click in order to gain money. There are 2 different counters: one for your total amount of clicks, and another for your money. The total amount of clicks will only go up, it's only to show how many clicks you've made. You can spend the money you've earned through the shop and bank.
- The shop has 2 items for purchase: a click value upgrade and a gambling button. A click value upgrade costs $5 and will make your clicks and money go up by 1 for each purchase. The gambling button will allow you to spend $20 to gamble, where you can gain or lose money. The gambling values are: -50, -20, 0, 10, and 50.
- The bank will allow you to loan $10. However, you will be $15 in debt. You must pay off this debt in order to get another loan.
- There are 5 achievements in this game: Starting your first click, getting to 100 clicks, getting to 1000 clicks, making your first gamble, and paying off your first loan.
